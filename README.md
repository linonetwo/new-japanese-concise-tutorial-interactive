## Technology

This project demonstrates basic usage of SoLiD POD (Linked Data Platform) and plugin architecture of SlateJS.

### SoLiD POD

#### List Files

In `src/store/texts.ts`, it uses `comunicaEngine` to load file list on a POD with `GraphQL`.

Texts was uploaded to [solid.authing.cn](https://new-japanese-concise-tutorial.solid.authing.cn/public/textbook/).

#### Search Related Knowledges

Fixed collocations and translation about text "です" are stored as triple on SoLiD POD, and connects to other knowledge as a web. These knowledge are searched by SPARQL and loaded as a list of Intellisense.

### SlateJS

`slate-mark-parsed` is a plugin that use provided parser (in this demo, [nlcst-parse-japanese](https://github.com/azu/nlp-pattern-match/blob/master/packages/nlcst-parse-japanese/README.md)) to get Natural Language Concrete Syntax Tree, and generate Slate Marks on the document.

`slate-mark-tooltip` consumes Slate Marks on a document, and provide VSCode style tooltip.
